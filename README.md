# Retention Cohort Analysis

## Problem
Retention reflects long-term product value better than acquisition metrics.  
This project analyzes **user retention using cohort analysis** to understand engagement patterns and churn.

---

## Analysis Performed
- Weekly cohort creation
- Retention matrix calculation
- Retention curve analysis
- Churn identification by cohort

---

## Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Python (Pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Insights
- Highest churn occurs in **Week 1**
- Retention stabilizes after **Week 3**
- Users who fail to complete onboarding show significantly lower retention

---

## Product Recommendations
- Focus experiments on first-week experience
- Monitor retention curves after feature releases
